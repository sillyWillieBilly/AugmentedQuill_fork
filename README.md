# AugmentedQuill

This fork adds a precise **Passage workshop**: leave the caret in a sentence or
select a passage, discuss alternatives with scoped lore, and explicitly apply one
checked edit with undo and recovery. It also imports and exports SillyTavern World
Info with a documented compatibility subset.

For this fork, run `make setup` once and `make run` to open
http://127.0.0.1:28000. Development mode is `make dev` on port 28001. Local projects
and model settings stay in ignored `.local-data/`.

Start with the [writer guide](docs/WRITER-WORKSPACE.md),
[fork development commands](docs/DEVELOPMENT.md),
[lore compatibility](docs/LORE-COMPATIBILITY.md), and
[manuscript copy importer](docs/MANUSCRIPT_IMPORT.md).
The [acceptance record](.dossier/evidence/writer-workspace-acceptance.md) identifies
the tested implementation and distinguishes real-model from mock checks.

**Local-first AI writing assistant with story structure + chatbot + image prompt support.**

- You are the author in the driver seat: your story is your story, and the AI is a creative partner (from brainstorm buddy to ghostwriter-style assistant) that supports your voice and choices.

## What is AugmentedQuill?

AugmentedQuill is a project-based writing environment for short stories, novels, and series. It combines a familiar three-panel writing interface (story structure + editor + AI chat) with AI tools that understand your story's context:

- **AI writing tools** — extend, rewrite, and suggest prose in the editor using your story's own context (chapters, summary, style tags).
- **AI chat assistant** — brainstorm, delegate prose, and manage your project (chapters, Sourcebook, metadata) through conversation.
- **Sourcebook** — keep characters, places, lore, and rules consistent; the AI uses the same canon on every call.
- **Story structure** — chapters, books, scenes, conflicts, and summaries keep long-form work organized.
- **Image prompts** — manage reference art and generate optimized image prompts from your project's style.

### Free, private, local-first

- **Open source & free** — AugmentedQuill is open source (GPLv3). There is no subscription, account, or usage fee.
- **Runs on your machine** — the app never runs in the cloud. Your projects, chapters, and Sourcebook stay in local folders on your own machine.
- **AI is your choice** — connect a local LLM (`llama.cpp`/Ollama) for zero running cost and full privacy, or optionally connect a cloud API (OpenAI, Claude, Google, DeepSeek, OpenRouter) if you prefer — a cloud provider is never required.

## Quick start

1. **Install** — download a ready-to-run build from the [Releases](https://github.com/StableLlamaAI/AugmentedQuill/releases) page, use [Docker](INSTALL.md#3-docker-best-for-self-hosters--home-servers), or [build from source](DEVELOPMENT.md). The full [Installation Guide](INSTALL.md) walks through every method.
2. **Connect an LLM provider** — AugmentedQuill does not bundle an AI server. Point it at a local `llama.cpp`/Ollama endpoint (free and private) or, if you choose, a cloud OpenAI-compatible API (OpenAI, Claude, Google Gemini, DeepSeek, OpenRouter) under **Settings → Machine Settings**.
3. **Start writing** — create a project (or let the Writing Partner do it for you) and talk to the AI chat.

## Security & deployment

AugmentedQuill is a local-first, single-user application with no built-in authentication. Do not expose it to the public internet without adding your own reverse proxy and access control.
